### Discussion

#### Formality
* We want Aggie Robotics to be formal enough to protect assets, without preventing any potential learning from taking place.
  * Mostly comes down to who has card access
  * Lab hours?
  * Extra hours can be available upon request and approval

#### Mission
* Freshmen are a large part of our audience
  * This puts a burden on us to provide good learning opportunities
  * Training is going to be _essential_
    * Breadboard
    * GitHub
    * Circuits Lab?
  * Advance as we go
* Can we build upon other topics as we go?
  * Would have to continually build upon topics to get more and more advanced.
  * "Checkpoints" every 2 weeks or so
* Allow students to store project in lockers as they progress
* Layout of the room must be more condusive to innovation
